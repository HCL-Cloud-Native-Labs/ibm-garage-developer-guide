Use Sysdig to monitor your running application

</PageDescription>

Sysdig Monitoring enables an operator to view stats and collect metrics about a Kubernetes cluster and its deployments.
The Developer Tools environment includes an IBM Cloud Monitoring with Sysdig service instance configured with 
a Sysdig agent installed in the environment's cluster.
Simply by deploying your application into the Developer Tools environment, Sysdig monitors it, just open 
the Sysdig web UI from the IBM Cloud dashboard to browse your application's status.

## Sysdig Monitoring

[IBM Cloud Monitoring with Sysdig](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/Monitoring-with-Sysdig) explains how to
configure and use an instance of the Sysdig service, but the Developer Tools environment has already done most 
of this for you. You can skip steps 1-3 about user access, provisioning an instance, and installing an agent.

### Sysdig dashboard

Open the Sysdig web UI for your environment's cluster
- [Step 4: Launch the web UI](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/Monitoring-with-Sysdig?topic=Sysdig-getting-started#step4) 
explains how to open the web UI
- In the IBM Cloud dashboard, navigate to **Observability** > **Monitoring**
- Find the monitoring instance named after your environment's cluster, such as `showcase-dev-iks-sysdig`. 
To help find it, you can filter by your resource group.

- In the monitoring instance, press the **View Sysdig** button to open the Sysdig web UI

Finish onboarding the agent
- If this is your first time opening the Sysdig dashboard on your cluster's monitoring agent, Sysdig will open the Onboarding wizard
- The first page shows the hosts (i.e. Kubernetes nodes) and containers that Sysdig found, as well as the integrations it has 
selected to monitor them

    Notice there are different types of integrations for different types of runtimes such as Java, servers such as Tomcat, 
    and even infrasturcture integrations for monitoring the Kubernetes cluster itself and its containerd engines.

- Press **Next**

- The second page shows the predefined metrics, dashboards, and alerts that Sysdig will start using to monitor the apps 
in your cluster

    - Press **Complete Onboarding**

### Explore your application

By default, the Sysdig dashboard opens the **Explore** page on its **Deployments and Pods** grouping.

- Select your cluster

By default, Sysdig opens its **Overview by Process** dashboard, which has panels showing stats about CPU, memory, and networking. 
This is one of Sysdig's **Default Dashboards** (i.e. built-in dashboards).

These are the cumlative totals for all of the pods running in the cluster. Hover over a graph and a key pops up to list 
the pods and show each one's color.

- Expand your cluster and namespace, then select your deployment

This shows the stats just for the pods in your deployment.

On the **Dashboard** page, you can create your own custom dashboards.

The Getting started tutorial, starting with 
[Step 5: Monitor your environment](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/Monitoring-with-Sysdig?topic=Sysdig-getting-started#step5), 
gives some instructions on monitoring, managing, and what to do next.

## Conclusion

It's important to be able to monitor your deployed applications. 
Here, the Developer Tools environment uses Sysdig Monitoring, but you never had to install or run Sysdig.
Just deploy your application into the Developer Tools environment and it gets moniotored automatically.
After deploying your application, open the Sysdig web UI and browse the status, including the status 
of your cluster as a whole and your deployment in particular.
