This guide will explain how to use Jenkins to manage your Continuous Integration process

</PageDescription>

Continous integration is a software development technique where software is built regularly by a team in an automated fashion.
This quote helps explain it:

> Continuous Integration is a software development practice where members of a team integrate their work frequently,
> usually each person integrates at least daily - leading to multiple integrations per day.
> Each integration is verified by an automated build (including test) to
> detect integration errors as quickly as possible. Many teams find that this approach leads to significantly
> reduced integration problems and allows a team to develop cohesive software more rapidly
> <cite>– Martin Fowler</cite>

## What is Jenkins

Jenkins is a self-contained, open source automation server that can be used to automate all sorts of tasks related to building, testing, and delivering or deploying software.
It is a perfect tool for helping manage continuous integration tasks for a wide range of software components.

Jenkins Pipeline (or simply "Pipeline") is a suite of plugins that supports implementing and integrating continuous delivery pipelines into Jenkins.

A continuous delivery pipeline is an automated expression of your process for getting software from version control right through to your users and customers.

Jenkins Pipeline provides an extensible set of tools for modeling simple-to-complex delivery pipelines "as code." The definition of a Jenkins Pipeline is typically written into a text file (called a [Jenkinsfile](https://jenkins.io/doc/pipeline/tour/hello-world/)) that in turn is checked into a project’s source control repository.



### Pipelines

Pipelines offer a set of stages or steps that can be chained together to allow a level of software
automation. This automation can be tailored to the specific project requirements.





### Stages

As you can see from either the vanilla Jenkins pipelines view of the Application Console pipelines view, each template 
offers a number of pipeline stages. The stages have been configured to be work from the defined `secrets` and `config maps` 
that have been defined in the Development Tools environment setup.

## Developer Tools Pipeline

The Developer Tools environment's Jenkinsfile pipeline uses stages that run in both Kubernetes and OpenShift. 
The Docker images are built from 
[UBI images](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/introducing-red-hat-universal-base-image) 
so that their containers can run in both Kubernetes and OpenShift.

These are the stages in the pipeline and a description of what each stage does. The **bold stage names** indicate 
the stages that are required; the ***italics stage names*** indicate optional stages that can be deleted or will be ignored if the tool 
supporting the stage is not installed. These stages represent a typical production pipeline flow for a cloud-native application.
- **Setup**: Clones the code into the pipeline
- **Build**: Runs the build commands for the code
- **Test**:	Validates the unit tests for the code
- ***Publish pacts***:	Publishes any pact contracts that have been defined
- ***Verify pact***: Verifies the pact contracts
- ***Sonar scan***: Runs a sonar code scan of the source code and publishes the results to SonarQube
- **Verify environment**: Validates the OpenShift or IKS environment configuration is valid
- **Build image**: Builds the code into a Docker images and stores it in the IBM Cloud Image registry
- **Deploy to DEV env**:	Deploys the Docker image tagged version to `dev` namespace using Helm Chart
- **Health Check**: Validates the Health Endpoint of the deployed application
- ***Package Helm Chart***: Stores the tagged version of the Helm chart in Artifactory
- ***Trigger CD Pipeline***: This is a GitOps stage that will update the build number in designated git repo and trigger ArgoCD for deployment to **test**


## Continious deployment

In addition to continous integration, the Developer Tools environment also supports continous deployment 
using Artifactory and ArgoCD:

You can use the [Argo CD Template](https://github.com/ibm-garage-cloud/template-argocd-test) to help define a deployment configuration for `test` and `staging` namespaces.
