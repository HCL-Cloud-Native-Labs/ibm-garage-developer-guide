<PageDescription>

Use Artifactory to store artifacts such as Helm charts

</PageDescription>

The Developer Tools environment creates a Helm repository in Artifactory and uses that to store Helm charts.

## What is artifact management

In a software development lifecycle (SDLC) or CI/CD pipeline, each stage produces artifacts: 
Jar files, container images, Helm charts, etc.
An artifact can be anything other than source code; an artifact is built or derived from source code, not directly edited by a developer.
Whereas source code is stored in a source code manager (SCM) such as Git and Docker images are stored in a Docker registry,
where are other types of artifacts stored? A repository manager handles artifact storage, access, versioning, and promotion lifecycle.

Artifactory, a product by JFrog, is an artifact repository manager that can run as a cloud service.

## Artifact management in the Pipeline

Note: Be sure to [set up Artifactory](/getting-started/artifactory-setup) before using it in the Development Tools environment.

The [Jenkins](/guides/continuous-integration) and [ArgoCD](/guides/continuous-delivery) CI/CD pipeline deploys applications 
using two types of artifacts: Docker images and Helm charts. 
A [Docker registry](https://docs.docker.com/registry/) stores Docker images, but it has no support for storing 
other types of artifacts. Helm charts are stored in a [Helm chart repository](https://helm.sh/docs/chart_repository/).

In the CI/CD pipeline, Jenkins builds the artifacts and ArgoCD deploys them. 
To store and share the artifacts, the pipeline uses to registries/repositories:
- **Docker images**: The [IBM Cloud Container Registry](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/Registry)
- **Helm charts**: A Helm repository in Artifactory

The [Starter Kit Templates](/starterkits/overview) have also been configured to store their Helm charts in Artificatory.

Artifactory is part of the Developer Tools environment's complete CI/CD solution:

### Artifactory dashboard

Open the Artifactory web UI for your environment.
- Use the [Developer Tools Dashboard](/getting-started/dashboard) to open the Artifactory dashboard

Browse the Helm repository.
- Go to the Artifact Repository Browser page
- Expand the tree for the `generic-local` repository, which is the Helm repository
- Expand the branch for your environment's cluster, such as `showcase-dev-iks`

The artifacts in the cluster's branch follow the [Helm chart repository](https://helm.sh/docs/chart_repository/) structure:
- **index.yaml**: Helm's index of all of the charts in the repository
- **charts**: The `tgz` files named for the application they deploy

Browse the artifacts to see how a Helm repository is organized.
- Select the `index.yaml` file and View it to see its contents
      ![Helm Repository Index](helm-repo-index.png)
- Expand a chart's branch to see that the `tgz` file contains the chart directory structure

Notice that each chart has its own URL in Artifactory, and index lists the URL for a chart.

## Conclusion

The Developer Tools environment includes a Helm repository hosted in Artifactory. 
As the Jenkins pipeline builds the Helm chart for an application, it stores the chart in the Artifactory repository. 
When the ArgoCD pipeline deploys an application, it retrieves the chart from the Artifactory repository.
