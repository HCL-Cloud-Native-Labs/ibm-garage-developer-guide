Use LogDNA to manage logging for your running application

</PageDescription>

LogDNA adds log management capabilities to a Kubernetes cluster and its deployments.
The Developer Tools environment includes an IBM Log Analysis with LogDNA service instance configured with 
a LogDNA agent installed in the environment's cluster.
Simply by deploying your application into the Developer Tools environment, LogDNA collects the logs, just open 
the LogDNA web UI from the IBM Cloud dashboard to browse your application's logs.

## LogDNA log management

[IBM Log Analysis with LogDNA](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/Log-Analysis-with-LogDNA) explains how to
configure and use an instance of the LogDNA service, but the Developer Tools environment has already done this for you. 
You can skip these steps about provisioning an instance, installing an agent, and user access.

### LogDNA dashboard

Open the LogDNA web UI for your environment's cluster

explains how to open the web UI
- In the IBM Cloud dashboard, navigate to **Observability** > **Logging**
