### Overview


### Tekton




### Pipelines

Pipelines offer a set of stages or steps that can be chained together to allow a level of software
automation. This automation can be tailored to the specific project requirements.





### Stages

You can see from either the vanilla Jenkins pipelines view of the Application Console pipelines view, each template offers a number of pipeline stages. The stages have been configured to be work from the defined `secrets` and `config maps` that have been defined in the Development cluster setup.

The following gives a description of what each stage in the pipeline does. The *Optional* stages can be deleted or ignored if the tool support it is not installed. These stages represent a typical production pipeline flow for a Cloud Native application.

- **Setup** clones the code into the pipeline
- **Build** runs the build commands for the code
- **Test**	validates the unit tests for the code
- **Publish pacts**	(*optional*) publishes any pact contracts that have been defined
- **Verify pact** (*optional*) verifies the pact contracts
- **Sonar scan** (*optional*) runs a sonar code scan of the source code and publishes the results to SonarQube
- **Verify environment** Validates the OpenShift or IKS environment configuration is valid
- **Build image** Builds the code into a Docker images and stores it in the IBM Cloud Image registry
- **Deploy to DEV env**	Deploys the Docker image tagged version to `dev` namespace using Helm Chart
- **Health Check** Validates the Health Endpoint of the deployed application
- **Package Helm Chart** (*optional*) Stores the tagged version of the Helm chart into Artifactory
- **Trigger CD Pipeline** (*optional*) This is a GitOps stage that will update the build number in designated git repo and trigger ArgoCD for deployment to **test**

## Registering Pipelines


Once you become familiar with deploying code into OpenShift or IKS, read up about how you can manage code deployment with `Continuous Deployment` with `Artiactory` and `ArgoCD`

- [Artiact Storage with Artifactory](./ARTIFACTORY.md)
- [Continuous Deployment with ArgoCD](./ARGOCD.md)

You can use the [Argo CD Template](https://github.com/ibm-garage-cloud/template-argocd-test) to help define a deployment configuration for `test` and `staging` namespaces.
