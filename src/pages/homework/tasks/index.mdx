### Homework Review Week 1

The homework review will take the form of a retrospective for the attendees who have completed the homework tasks. We are looking for feedback from three perspectives:

- **What went well?**
- **What needs improvement?**
- **Next steps?**

Students will begin this **MOOC** with different skill levels and familiarity with this material, but will complete the MOOC ready to perform a Garage engagement. Each student's **Next Steps** will help identify that person's skill gaps to ensure they cover the topics needed to complete the **MOOC** successfully.

Please use the [online retrospective](https://reetro-io.herokuapp.com/board/5dc4fca0074a5400170d9c93/5dc4fca0074a5400170d9c95) board during the live Homework session to evaluate the session. As students enter feedback, we'll all be able to see it on this shared screen.
