### Home Work Review Week 1

The homework review will take the form of a retrospective with the attendees that have completed the tasks during the homework week. We are looking for three key elements of feedback:

- **What went well?**
- **What needs improvement?**
- **Next Steps ?**

We are expecting a wide variety of skill levels working through this material. The **Next Steps** will factor in the expected areas of clarity and skills improvements that maybe required. The key objective is to prepare developers and architects with the skills to perform a Garage engagement as confidently as they can.

Please use the [online retrospective](https://reetro-io.herokuapp.com/board/5dc4fca0074a5400170d9c93/5dc4fca0074a5400170d9c95) board during the live Homework session
