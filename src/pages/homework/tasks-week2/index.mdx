## Week 2 - The Day 2 Developer Experience

The homework for **Session 1, Week 2** is focused on how a development team would deliver,operate, secure and manage their applications. This is often refereed to as **Day 2 Developer Experience** . As a team executes the key agile ceremonies using the Garage Method its important for developers and architects to understand that moving software consistently and reliably to test and then onto production is a critical skill for cloud native developers.

This weeks homework involves a number of tasks that are more advanced that week from week 1, so the advice is take your time and do some research on the topic

This homework assumes that you have:
 - Reviewed the **Playback** from the Week 1 Monday session
 - Seen a demo of each of the homework tasks below

What is very clear is that with Red Hat OpenShift and IBM Kubernetes managed services combined with the powerful cloud services and with IBM Garage for Cloud Developer tools you have a powerful development platform to enable you to build any form of cloud native solution. Watch out for the **IBM Cloud Pak Developers Guide** coming in 2020.
