**Warning:** If you do not enroll on the class you will not be given access to the **MOOC** shared education sandbox cluster. Enrollment will enable you to be added to the development environment on the IBM Cloud.

### Notification

- After the first live web cast has completed you will receive an email giving you details on how to access your development team cluster. you will be allocated to a team.

- The team names use the convention `mooc-team-one`, `mooc-team-two`,`mooc-team-n..` you will have received you team name in your notification email.

- The notification email will include the name of the **Account Sandbox** you have been added too and which **Development Team Cluster** you have been allocated.

- You must associate your IBM email address with your public git hub account or make sure you have a public account that is using your IBM email address.
    - Log into [Github](https://github.com)
    - Navigate to you account settings
    - Select emails, check your IBM email address is your primary email for the account
    - If it is not then add you IBM email and verify it
    - If you are correctly verified and associated you will receive a second email inviting you to your associated git organizations

**Warning:** If you do associate your IBM email with you public git hub account you will have issues completing the homework.

- The Sandbox has been defined exactly how a client would use the IBM Cloud and you will be given access to a specific team `Resource Group` and `Access Group`. This will then enable you to access the development clusters for IBM Kubernetes and Red Hat OpenShift. The Resource group will have pre installed content and you will be restricted from creating new cloud services or deleting existing ones.

- Each **Development Team** will consist of **30+** Garage colleagues.


The following diagram helps to explain how access will be configured. Imagine you are the `Green` user, there will be lots of other users around you maybe in different timezones all sharing the same clusters resources. The administrators will be monitoring the cluster to identify any possible issues early and resolving them.

- You will be given access to a team git organization. You will be expected to create all your git projects in your teams organization. This is how real world development projects work. This will enable you to collaborate with your fellow team members and will prevent you from creating duplicate projects names.

There will an IBM Kubernetes Cluster in the same `Resource Group` and you will get bonus _credits_ if you can deliver some of the home work onto that cluster as well. IBM Garage is getting a number of client requests that may require upstream kubernetes to be used for specific use cases. It is important you become familiar with both premier container platforms. The developer experience is the same for both container platforms.

## Team Locations

The teams are spread globally in three geographic locations listed below. We will try and make team membership as close to your home Garage as possible.

## Validating your access the IBM Cloud

<InlineNotification>

**Note**: If you have issues with any of the following steps please raise an issue on the `#openshift-cldpak-mooc` slack channel. All homework issues should be raised on the `#catalyst-project` channel.

</InlineNotification>

Follow these steps to check you can access your **Teams Development Cluster**:

- Login to the [IBM Cloud](https://cloud.ibm.com)
- In the _notification email_ you will be notified of the account sandbox you have been allocated too
- Check you can see that account in the Accounts drop down
- Change the Accounts drop down to your allocated sandbox account
- Click on *Resource List*
- Type in your team name in the Groups filter ie. `mooc-team-one`
![Resoure List](resourcelist.png)
- Click on the **Expand All** (top right)
- You should see two Clusters labelled `mooc-one-rhos-cluster` and `mooc-one-iks-cluster`
- Enter `rhos` in Tags filter, you will see just the Red Hat OpenShift cluster and services
![Resoure List](devtoolsservices.png)
- Click on the Red Hat OpenShift cluster to open its dashboard
- Click on the **Access** tab
- Follow the instructions to access the cluster from the command line , validate you are successful
- Return to the cluster dashboard
- Validate you can access the dashboards for each of the bound services
- Click on the *Open Web Console*
- Check that you can access the Red Hat OpenShift Console
- Return to the **Resource List**
- Remove the `rhos` tag and add the `iks` tag
- Repeat the same steps for your teams IBM Kubernetes cluster and services

<InlineNotification kind="success">

If you have managed to access IBM Cloud account and open your teams Red Hat OpenShift Cluster and accessed the cluster from the command you have completed this homework task.

## Etiquette

Please remember you will be using a development cluster with other colleagues, be considerate of the following rules:

- Make sure you use your own namespace/project for you applications
- Name your personal namespace/project using this convention `dev-{your initials}` ie. `dev-mjp`
- Any namespaces/projects not following this approach will be deleted by the [master builders](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um-PlX6oPBQ)
- Add initials `{<app name}w-{your initials}` to the end of your app names ie. `inventory-bff-mjp` The use of the team git organization will help with not creating apps with the same name.
- Talk to you fellow team members using slack to help debug issues
- Use the Github team discussion feature to share knowledge
- Do not delete anything that is not yours in the cluster especially `secrets` and `configMaps` this will cause unnecessary pain for [master builders](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um-PlX6oPBQ)
- Do not delete other peoples `pipelines` or `deployed apps`
- Do not create anything that will cause unnecessary stress to your teams Red Hat Cluster or the `MOOC Account`
- Remember part of the learning is showing you how to be team members working on multiple microservices in the same development cluster with other developers.
- Remember running an app on your laptop does not trump running code in a cluster
- Remember IBM Cloud is like one big lego set of software and services. After this course you be on your way to be a `master builder` its loads of fun
