title: Validate IBM Cloud Account
---

# Sign Up

When you sign up to attend `MOOC` you will be allocated to a team and informed of your team number through email. Once you receive the email you will have been added to the correct `Access Group` and `Resource Group`. Each team will consist of up to **25** Garage colleagues.

## Team Allocation

The team names use the convention `mooc-team-one`, `mooc-team-two`,`mooc-team-n..` If we have high participation we will keep adding clusters to support the attendance. The following diagram helps to explain how you will be configured. Imagine you are the `Green` user, there will be lots of other users around you maybe in different timezones.

There will also be an IBM Kubernetes Cluster in the same `Resource Group` and it you will get bonus credits if you can deliver some of the home work onto that as well. IBM Garage is getting a number of client requests that may require upstream kubernetes to be used.

## Etiquette

Please remember you will be using a development cluster with other colleagues, be considerate of the following rules:

- Make sure you use your own namespace/project for you CI applications
- Name your personal namespace/project using this convention `mooc-<teamnumber>-<initials` ie. `mooc-one-mjp`
- Any namespaces/projects not following this approach will be deleted by the [master builders](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um-PlX6oPBQ)
- Add initials to the end of your app names `inventory-bff-mjp` the environment is real and name clashing may result in deployment errors and images being over ridden
- Talk to you fellow team members using slack to help debug issues
- Do not delete anything that is not yours in the cluster especially `secrets` and `configMaps` this will cause unnecessary pain for administrators
- Do not delete other peoples `pipelines` or `deployed apps`
- Do not create anything that will cause unnecessary stress to your teams Red Hat Cluster or the `MOOC Account`
- Remember part of the learning is showing you how to be team members working on multiple microservices into the same development cluster.
- Remember IBM Cloud is a Lego Set try and become a `master builder` its loads of fun
