# IBM Garage for Cloud
## Developer Tools

### Overview

The Developer Tools have been designed to help a team configure a set of popular open source tools that can enable
cloud native development. Typically a squad lead or lead developer install and setup these tools after the
initial inception workshop. The objective of this is to reduce the amount of time a team needs to configure and prepare their Kubernetes or OpenShift development environments.
Some key benefits of this is that it makes the whole development lifecycle for Kubernetes and OpenShift
consistent and simpler thank the out of the box experience.

The installation is managed with Terraform and it enables it to be modular in configuration
so tools can be easily disabled or new tools added. This combination of tools are proven in the
industry to deliver real value for modern cloud native development.

The Red Hat Innovation Lab has a very similar approach to how they deliver success with OpenShift, view their approach [here](https://github.com/rht-labs/labs-ci-cd).

This repo contains Terraform resources that will deploy the following development tools into a Kubernetes or OpenShift cluster.

- IBM Container Service Cluster (3 nodes) for Kubernetes or OpenShift
- Create *dev*,*test*,*staging* and *tools* namespaces
- Install the following tools:
    - [Jenkins CI](https://jenkins.io/)
    - [Argo CD](https://argoproj.github.io/argo-cd/)
    - [SonarQube](https://www.sonarqube.org/)
    - [Pack Broker](https://docs.pact.io/)
    - [Artifactory](https://jfrog.com/open-source/)
    - [Eclipse CHE](https://www.eclipse.org/che/)

- Create and bind the following Cloud Services to your Cluster:
    - [AppID Application Authentication](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/appid?topic=appid-service-access-management)
    - [Cloudant NoSQL Database](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/Cloudant?topic=cloudant-getting-started)
    - [Cloud Object Storage Storage](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/cloud-object-storage?topic=cloud-object-storage-getting-started)
    - [LogDNA Logging](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/Log-Analysis-with-LogDNA?topic=LogDNA-getting-started)
    - [SysDig Monitoring](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/Monitoring-with-Sysdig?topic=Sysdig-getting-started)
    - [PostgreSQL](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/databases-for-postgresql?topic=databases-for-postgresql-about) (used by SonarQube)

### Guides

The following Guides explain how to create and deploy applications using Continuous Integration with Jenkins. They help explain how to integrate code analysis into your applications with SonarQube. They explain how to move applications into test, staging and production using Continous Deployment techniques with Artifactory and Argo CD and much more.
