## Iteration Zero for IBM Cloud

This repository contains tools and Terraform infrastructure as code (IasC) to help setup an IBM Cloud Public development
environment ready for cloud native application development with IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service or Red Hat OpenShift for IBM Kubernetes Service.

### Overview

Iteration Zero has been designed to help a team configure a set of popular open source tools that can enable cloud native development. Typically a squad lead or lead developer would use this Terraform package after the initial inception workshop has completed and the development team is ready to write code. The objective and goal of this is to reduce the amount of time a team needs to configure and prepare their Kubernetes or OpenShift development environments. Some key benifits of Iteration Zero is that it makes the whole development lifecycle for IKS and OpenShift much smoother and easier than using the out of the box experience. Using Terraform enables it to be modular in configuration so tools can be easily disabled or new tools added. This combindation of tools are proven in the industry to deliver real value for modern cloud native development.

The Red Hat Innovation Lab has a very similar approach to how they deliver success with OpenShift, view their approach [here](https://github.com/rht-labs/labs-ci-cd).

You can jump straight to the [Developers Guide](https://ibm-garage-cloud.github.io/garage-developer-guide/) if you want more detail on how Iteration Zero fits into the end to end developer story.

This repo contains Terraform resources that will deploy the following development tools into your IKS or OpenShift infrastructure.

- IBM Container Service Cluster (3 nodes) for IKS or OpenShift
- Create *dev*,*test*,*staging* and *tools* namespaces
- Install the following tools:
    - [Jenkins CI](https://jenkins.io/)
    - [Argo CD](https://argoproj.github.io/argo-cd/)
    - [SonarQube](https://www.sonarqube.org/)
    - [Pack Broker](https://docs.pact.io/)
    - [Artefactory](https://jfrog.com/open-source/)
    - [Eclipse CHE](https://www.eclipse.org/che/)

- Create and bind the following Cloud Services to your Cluster:
    - [AppID Application Authentication](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/appid?topic=appid-service-access-management)
    - [Cloudant NoSQL Database](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/Cloudant?topic=cloudant-getting-started)
    - [Cloud Object Storage Storage](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/cloud-object-storage?topic=cloud-object-storage-getting-started)
    - [LogDNA Logging](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/Log-Analysis-with-LogDNA?topic=LogDNA-getting-started)
    - [SysDig Monitoring](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/Monitoring-with-Sysdig?topic=Sysdig-getting-started)
    - [PostgreSQL](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/databases-for-postgresql?topic=databases-for-postgresql-about) (used by SonarQube)

### Guides

The following Guides explain how to create and deploy applications using Continuous Integration with Jenkins. They help explain how to integrate code analysis into your applications with SonarQube. They explain how to move applications into test, staging and production using Continous Deployment techniques with Artifactory and Argo CD and much more.
