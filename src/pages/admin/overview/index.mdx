## Paths to Installation

The IBM Garage for Cloud Developer Tools supports the installation into a number of
Kubernetes-based cluster technologies. The tools can be installed into multiple clusters and support **IBM Kubernetes** and **Red Hat OpenShift** managed cluster environments. The installation process is built using **Terraform Infrastructure as Code**. For a more detailed explanation on this you can read the [Infrastructure as Code Guide](/guides/iasc).

- Complete the installation and setup of the [Prerequisites](/getting-started/pre-reqs) before starting any of the installations paths.

Select the approach that best suites your requirement:
- If its a brand new project or being managed by a _Cloud Administrator_, use the *New* path
- If you have an existing IBM Cloud managed cluster, use the *Existing* approach
- If you want to do local development on your laptop use *OpenShift 4 CodeReady Containers* path
