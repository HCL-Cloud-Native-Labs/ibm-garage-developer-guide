## Roles

A Developer Tools environment is installed and managed by users acting in two roles:
- **Account administrator**: Account owner or other user with sufficient [account management permissions](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/resources?topic=resources-bp_resourcegroups#bp_resourcegroups)
- **Environment administrator**: A user in the account with [the administrator role for all services](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/iam?topic=iam-cloudaccess)

The same user can perform both roles. The separate roles enable some users to focus on managing the account while other users focus on managing the environments in the account. One set of users can manage all environments or a different set of users can manage each environment.

The account administrator must decide which role should be used to create clusters:
- **Environment administrator creates clusters**: The account administrator can grant permission to create clusters to the environment administrator (in addition to permission to create service instances), in which case the environment administrator can run the scripts to create the entire environment.
- **Account administrator creates clusters**: The account administrator DOES NOT grant the environment administrator permission to create clusters (only service instances), in which case the account administrator will have to create the cluster for an environment so that the environment administrator can install the environment into the existing cluster.

## End-to-end installation

This is the overview of everything needed to install a Development Tools environment and get it ready for developers to use it.

### Configure IBM Cloud account

First, before installing an environment, the account administrator needs to
 [configure the IBM Cloud account](/admin/config-account) for the
  environment:
- Decide which data center (region and zone) will host the environment
- Determine which public/private VLAN pair will comprise the environment's network
- Determine which resource group will contain the environment's resources
- Determine which access groups will enable administrators and developers to access to the environment's resources

### Install environment

Second, once the account administrator has configured the account for installing an environment, the account administrator and the environment administrator need to jointly decide how the environment administrator is going to install the environment. There are two options:

[**Install including creating a new cluster**](/admin/installation-ibm-cloud): The environment administrator who performs this install needs permissions to create clusters as well as service instances. The script will run as this user to create the cluster, create the service instances, and install the CI/CD tools in the cluster.

[**Install into an existing cluster**](/admin/installation-existing): The account administrator creates the cluster and then grants the environment administrator access to it. The environment administrator who performs this install needs permissions to create service instances but not to create clusters. The script will run as the environment administrator to create the service instances and install the CI/CD tools in the existing cluster.

**Note**: A third option is to [install an environment in Red Hat CodeReady Containers](/admin/installation-crc). For this option, you're not installing in IBM Cloud, so you don't have to configure your IBM Cloud account. However, you do have to install CRC.

### Configure environment

Third, after you install the environment, before giving the developers access
 to the environment, the environment administrator need to [finish
  configuring it](/admin/config-install):
- Configure RBAC security in the cluster
- Test opening the Developer Tools Dashboard
- Complete setup of LogDNA
- Complete setup of SysDig
- Test the pipeline by deploying a first app
- Complete setup of Artifactory
- Complete setup of Argo CD
- Rerun pipeline and confirm that the app's Helm chart is added to Artifactory
- Set up a GitOps repo to validate ArgoCD setup and configuration

## Conclusion

Having configured the account, installed the environment, and configured the environment, the administrators have now completed an end-to-end installation of a Developer Tools environment. It is ready for a development team to begin using for application development.
