title: IBM Cloud Pak for Applications - Microservices
---

<PageDescription>

Use IBM Cloud Pak for Applications to integrate microservices.

For this homework you will use two existing applications and deploy them as a set of microservices using the CP4Apps workflow.

This guide assumes the following:

1. You are using a Developer Tools environment that has already been installed
1. Cloud Pack for Applications has already been installed in the environment.
1. You already completed [CP4Apps homeworks](/practical/cp4apps)


## Deploy existing Backend as Appsody App

- Create the backend project using the following template https://github.com/kabanero-demo/appsody-backend

- Click on `Use this template` and use your assigned MOOC github organization `https://github.com/mooc-team-{id}/appsody-backend-{initials}` for example: `https://github.com/mooc-team-one/appsody-backend-cs`

- Clone the new Github repo locally

- Initialize existing App with appsody CLI
    ```bash
    appsody init kabanero-0.2.1/nodejs-express none
    ```
- Run the App with appsody locally and access on http://localhost:3001 (port 3000 will be use later for frontend)
    ```bash
    appsody run -p 3001:3000 -p 9230:9229 -p 8081:8080
    ``` 
- Add deployment manifest
    ```bash
    appsody deploy --generate-only
    ```
- Add the namespace to deploy the App, edit `app-deploy.yaml`
    ```yaml
    metadata:
      namespace: dev-{initials}
    ```
- Commit and push the new appsody related files
    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "Add appsody files"
    git push
    ``` 
- Create a Webhook on your Github repo to trigger the Tekton Pipeline following the instructions from [Tekton Pipelines Homework](/practical/cp4apps#build-an-app-with-a-tekton-pipeline)

## Deploy existing Frontend as Appsody App

- Create the frontend project using the following template https://github.com/kabanero-demo/appsody-frontend

- Click on `Use this template` and use your assigned MOOC github organization `https://github.com/mooc-team-{id}/appsody-frontend-{initials}` for example: `https://github.com/mooc-team-one/appsody-frontend-cs`

- Clone the new Github repo locally

- Initialize existing App with appsody CLI
    ```bash
    appsody init kabanero-0.2.1/nodejs-express none
    ```
- Run the App with appsody locally and access on http://localhost:3000 (port 3001 is used by the backend)
    ```bash
    appsody run
    ```
- Test the app by adding a new user, make sure the backend is running with appsody and exposed on port 3001
- Add deployment manifest
    ```bash
    appsody deploy --generate-only
    ```
- Add the namespace to deploy the App, edit `app-deploy.yaml`
    ```yaml
    metadata:
      namespace: dev-{initials}
    ```
- Add environment variable to link backend service on port 3000 to frontend service, edit `app-deploy.yaml`
    ```yaml
    spec:
      env:
        - name: APPSODY_BACKEND_DEFAULT_URL
          value: http://appsody-backend-{initials}:3000/
    ```
- Commit and push the new appsody related files
    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "Add appsody files"
    git push
    ``` 
- Create a Webhook on your Github repo to trigger the Tekton Pipeline following the instructions from [Tekton Pipelines Homework](/practical/cp4apps#build-an-app-with-a-tekton-pipeline)

## Verify deployed Microservices

- Open your project using the OpenShift Console
- Verify there are two applications corresponding to the frontend and backend services

- Access the route for the frontend service and register a new user
