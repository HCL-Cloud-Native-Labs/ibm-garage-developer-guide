Prepare to run the scripts that create a cluster

</PageDescription>

The IBM Garage for Cloud Developer Tools facilitate development and deployment of cloud-native applications. 
They can be hosted in any Kubernetes or OpenShift cluster.
In IBM Cloud, the cluster is hosted by either the [IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers) or 
[Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/openshift). 
These instructions explain how to access, configure, and run the scripts to create the Developer Tools environment.

The following pre-requisites are required before following the setup instructions:

- An IBM Cloud account with:
    - the ability to provision resources to support [Kubernetes](https://cloud.ibm.com/kubernetes/clusters) 
    and [OpenShift](https://cloud.ibm.com/kubernetes/clusters?platformType=openshift) environments
    - the ability to create a [Resource Group](https://cloud.ibm.com/account/resource-groups) for your development resources and admin rights to this resource group
    - a region and zone containing [a pair of public and private VLANs](https://cloud.ibm.com/classic/network/vlans)
- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) installed and running on your local machine
- [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed on your local machine

Obtain the scripts that create the environment

</PageDescription>

Clone the [ibm-garage-iteration-zero](https://github.com/ibm-garage-cloud/ibm-garage-iteration-zero) Git repository to your local filesystem

```bash
git clone git@github.com:ibm-garage-cloud/ibm-garage-iteration-zero.git
```

Switch to the cloned directory

```bash
cd ibm-garage-iteration-zero
```
</Tab>

<Tab label="2. API keys">

<PageDescription>

Configure the keys the CLI uses to authenticate

</PageDescription>

A Kubernetes or OpenShift clutser is a PaaS resource hosted in IaaS resources. 
API keys authenticate an [IBM Cloud CLI](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cli "IBM Cloud CLI and Developer Tools") 
client--such as a Terraform script--to create these resources programatically. Two keys will be needed:
- The first key authorizes creating Classic Infrastructure (IaaS) resources
- The second key authorizes creating IBM Cloud (PaaS) resources

The following steps create the required keys and put them into a file called `credentials.properties`.

```bash
classic.username=<CLASSIC_USERNAME>
classic.api.key=<CLASSIC_API_KEY>
ibmcloud.api.key=<IBMCLOUD_API_KEY>
```

The installation scripts will use these settings to authenticate to IBM Cloud.

### Step A. Create the credentials.properties file

- Inside the `iteration-zero-ibmcloud` folder, copy `credentials.template` to a file named `credentials.properties`.

```bash
cd iteration-zero-ibmcloud
cp credentials.template credentials.properties
```

The `credentials.properties` file is already listed in the `.gitignore` file so that the file containing 
your private API keys will not be pushed to the server repository.

### Step B. Set the Classic infrastructure API key

- Follow these instructions to [create a Classic infrastructure API key](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/iam?topic=iam-classic_keys "Managing classic infrastructure API keys"):

    - In the IBM Cloud console, go to the IBM Cloud API Keys page

    To open the IBM Cloud API Keys page, select **Manage -> Access (IAM)**, then select the **IBM Cloud API keys** tab.

    - If your account already has a classic infrastructure API key, it will appear in the list of keys as **Classic infrastructure API key**. Otherwise, the page will have a **Create a classic infrastructure API key** button on the top. To crate the key, press that button and close the dialog.

    ![API Keys](apikeys.png)

    - Find **Classic infrastructure API key** in the list and open its details.

    ![Classic Keys](classickeys.png)

- Edit the `credentials.properties` file to set the values for the `classic.username` and `classic.api.key` properties.

### Step C. Set the IBM Cloud API key

- Follow these instructions to create an IBM Cloud API key:

    - [Managing user API keys](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/iam?topic=iam-userapikey "Managing user API keys")

- Edit the `credentials.properties` file to set the value for the `ibmcloud.api.key` property.

<Tab label="3. Configuration">

<PageDescription>

Configure the properties describing the environment

</PageDescription>

The settings for creating the Developer Tools environment go in two properties files
in the `./terraform/settings` directory:
- `environment.tfvars` -- Properties for installing the Developer Tools
- `vlan.tfvars` -- Properties for creating the cluster

The next few steps will find the necessary resources and set them in the `tfvars` files. 
Along the way, if any of these resources don't already exist, you'll need to create them.
There is a tool for optionally generating the VLAN variables. 

### Environment variables

The `environment.tfvars` properties will be used to install the Development Tools.

Typical values look like this:

```bash
resource_group_name="catalyst-team"
cluster_name="catalyst-team-cluster"
# The type of cluster that will be created/used (kubernetes or openshift)
cluster_type="kubernetes"
# Flag indicating if we are using an existing cluster or creating a new one
cluster_exists="false"
# Flag indicating if we are using an existing PostgreSQL server or creating a new one
postgres_server_exists="false"
```

You must set `resource_group_name` and `cluster_name`. 
The others have reasonable defaults that you can change if desired: 
- Set `cluster_type` to specify whether the cluster is Kubernetes or OpenShift.
- Set `postgres_server_exists` to specify that the existing cluster already has a PostgreSQL service instance.

### VLAN variables

The `vlan.tfvars` properties will be used to create the cluster that the Developer Tools will be installed into.

Typical values look like this:

```bash
vlan_region="us-south"
vlan_datacenter="dal10"
public_vlan_id="2366011"
private_vlan_id="2366012"
```

You must set all of these specifically for your cluster. The IGC CLI can be used to generate reasonable settings.

### Optional: Generate the properties

If your account has numerous VLANs and you want your Developer Tools cluster to use specific ones, then skip this step. 
This tool is for users who don't know what these required settings should be and want a simple way 
to gather reasonable defaults for their particular account.

The [IGC CLI](cli) has a command to gather this information for you, 
in a format that is easy to cut/paste into the `vlan.tfvars` properties file. 

```bash
igc vlan
```

Note that you need to log into your account using the IBM Cloud CLI to use this tool.

<Tab label="3a. Resources">

<PageDescription>

Configure the property specifying the resource group and VLANs

</PageDescription>

These details explain how to find the necessary resources and complete the `environment.tfvars` and `vlan.tfvars` files.

### Resource group

The Developer Tools environment consists of several IBM Cloud resources--a Kubernetes or OpenShift cluster, 
some cloud service instances, etc. 
[IBM Cloud Identity and Access Management](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/iam "Managing identity and access") 
manages access to resources by organizing them into resource groups, so that one access policy can easily be applied 
to all of the resources in a group. 

In `environment.tfvars`, set the `resource_group_name` property to specify the resource group for the environment's resources. 
This resource group enables all of the resources to work together 
and will help distinguish the Developer Tools resources from the other resources in the same IBM Cloud account. 
The resource group can be a new one--see the instructions below.

- Follow these instructions to create a resource group:

    - [Creating a resource group](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/resources?topic=resources-rgs#create_rgs "Creating and managing resource groups")

### Cluster name

The heart of the Developer Tools environment is a cluster, either Kubernetes or OpenShift (as specified in the `cluster_type` property). 
In `environment.tfvars`, set the `cluster_name` property to any valid cluster name that is not already in use.

### VLANs

The heart of the Developer Tools environment is a cluster, either Kubernetes or OpenShift.
In IBM Cloud, a single zone cluster is 
[hosted in a particular zone in a particular region](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/overview?topic=overview-zero-downtime#ov_intro_reg "Locations for resource deployment"). 
If the account you're using has multiple regions and zones, you need to decide what region and zone you'll want the cluster cerated in. 

In `vlan.tfvars`, set the following properties:
- `vlan_region` -- The region that the cluster is or will be in
- `vlan_datacenter` -- The zone in that region that the cluster is or will be in

The [networking in a Kubernetes or OpenShift cluster](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-plan_clusters#plan_basics "Understanding network basics of classic clusters") 
consists of (at a minimum) two VLANs, a public VLAN and a private VLAN. 
Specify a pair of VLANs in the desired region and zone.

In `vlan.tfvars`, set the following properties:
- `public_vlan_id` -- The public VLAN that the cluster will use
- `private_vlan_id` -- The private VLAN that the cluster will use

An earlier step talked about using the `igc vlan` command in the [Developer Tools CLI](cli)
to gather these VLAN settings. 

Advanced users who want to specifiy the settings can determine the VLAN info manually: 
[Getting started with VLANs](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/infrastructure/vlans "VLANs") explains how to open the
VLAN List page in the console. Choose the public and private VLANs for the region and zone you want to
host the Developer Tools environment. If suitable VLANs don't already exist, you will need to create them here.

<Tab label="4. Run">

<PageDescription>

Run the scripts that create the environment

</PageDescription>

Having configured the `credentials.properties`, `environment.tfvars`, and `vlan.tfvars` properties files, 
we are now ready to kick off the installation.

- Launch a [Developer Tools Docker container](https://github.com/ibm-garage-cloud/ibm-garage-cli-tools "Cloud Garage Tools Docker image").

    Run the following command to run the Docker container:

    ```bash
    ./launch.sh
    ```

    This will install the Cloud Garage Tools Docker image and exec shell into the running container. The container will 
    mount the filesystem's `./terraform/` directory as `/home/devops/src/`. Once the Docker container has started and 
    the script has exec shelled into it, you will see an IBM Garage banner. This will help you identify you are running 
    inside the Docker image that has just mounted your file system.

    ```bash
    % ./launch.sh
    Cleaning up old container: ibm-garage-cli-tools-abcde

    Run 'image-help' to get a list of available tools, scripts, and ENV properties
    ```

    The `image-help` command shows what can be done in this conatiner:

    ```bash
    $ image-help
    Available env properties (can be overridden for individual commands):
    > BM_API_KEY - the IBM Cloud api key
    > REGION - the IBM Cloud region (e.g. us-south)
    > RESOURCE_GROUP - the IBM Cloud resource group
    > CLUSTER_NAME - the name of the kubernetes cluster in IBM Cloud
    > SL_USERNAME - the Classic Infrastructure user name or API user name (e.g. 282165_joe@us.ibm.com)
    > SL_API_KEY - the Classic Infrastructure api key

    Available tools:
    > terraform (with helm, kube, and ibm provider plugins)
    > calicoctl
    > ibmcloud (with container-service, container-registry, and cloud-databases plugins)
    > kubectl
    > kustomize
    > oc
    > helm
    > docker
    > git
    > nvm
    > node (v11.12.0 currently installed)
    > yo

    Available scripts:
    > init.sh {BM_API_KEY} {REGION} {RESOURCE_GROUP} {CLUSTER_NAME}
    > createNamespaces.sh
    > deleteNamespace.sh
    > installHelm.sh
    > cluster-pull-secret-apply.sh
    > setup-namespace-pull-secrets.sh
    > checkPodRunning.sh
    > copy-secret-to-namespace.sh
    ```

- Create the Developer Tools environment

    The supplied Terraform script is ready to run using the settings in the properties files. 
    You optionally can extend or modify the scripts and tailor them for your project's specific needs.

    Run this script in the container:

    ```bash
    ./runTerraform.sh
    ```

    This script will create the Developer Tools environment.

    The script will verify some basic settings and prompt if you want to proceed. After you select **Y** (for yes), 
    the Terraform Apply process will begin to create the infrastructure and services for your environment.

    Creating a new cluster takes about 1.5 hours on average (but can also take considerably longer) 
    and the rest of the process takes about 30 minutes. At the end, you should have your Developer Tools environment 
    fully provisioned and configured. Enjoy!

### Developer Tools environment

Once the Terraform scripts have finished, you can see the resources that the scripts created in IBM Cloud:
- In the IBM Cloud console, open the [Resource List](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/overview?topic=overview-ui#dashboardview "Managing resources in the resource list")
- On the Resource List page, filter by your Resource Group (e.g. `catalyst-team`)
- You should see these resources listed:
    - **Clusters**: 1, either Kubernetes or OpenShift
    - **Services**: 5 or so, such as PostgreSQL, LogDNA, etc.
    - **Storage**: 1, an instance of Cloud Object Storage
- Select the cluster and open the Kubernetes dashboard or OpenShift web console. You should see:
    - Namespaces: `tools`, `dev`, `test`, and `staging`
    - Deployments in the `tools` namespace: `catalyst-dashboard`, `jenkins`, etc.

### Possible issues

If you find that that the Terraform provisioning has failed, try re-running the `runTerraform.sh` script again. 
The state will be saved and Terraform will try and apply the configuration to match the desired end state.

If you find that some of the services have failed to create in the time allocated, you can try this:
- Manually delete the service instances in your resource group
- Delete the `workspace` directory (which will remove any state that has been created by Terraform)
- Re-run the `runTerraform.sh` script

```bash
rm -rf workspace
./runTerraform.sh
```
