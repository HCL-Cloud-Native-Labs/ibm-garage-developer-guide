<PageDescription>

The Cloud Developer Tools include the
[IBM Garage Cloud (IGC) Developer Tools](https://github.com/ibm-garage-cloud/ibm-garage-cloud-cli) Command Line Interface (CLI)

</PageDescription>

The CLI provides a set of helpful utilities that can be invoked from the command line. 
These utilities include:
- Register your application's git repo into a **Jenkins** pipeline
- List the ingress URLs for the tools installed in the environment
- List the user names and passwords for the tools installed in the environment
- Build and deploy images to the environment using the IBM Cloud Image Registery


To use the CLI, it must be installed and your command line shell must be logged into IBM Cloud.

## Installation

Follow these steps to use the IGC CLI:
- Install the CLI:
    ```bash
    npm i -g @garage-catalyst/ibm-garage-cloud-cli
    ````
- Run the CLI's help command to list the available commands:
    ```bash
    igc --help
    ```

    The help output looks like this:

    ```bash
    % igc --help
    IBM Garage Cloud CLI

    Usage: igc <command> [args]

    Commands:
    igc jenkins-auth  Generate a Jenkins api token and register it as kubernetes
                        secret
    igc gen-token     Generate a Jenkins api token
    igc pipeline      Register a pipeline for the current code repository in
                        Jenkins                                  [aliases: register]
    igc git-webhook   Create a git webhook for a given Jenkins pipeline
    igc build         Build the image and push it into the IBM Cloud registry
    igc deploy        Deploy an image from the IBM Cloud registry into a
                        kubernetes cluster
    igc tools         Launch the IBM Garage for Cloud tools image connected to the
                        current directory
    igc vlan          Print out the vlan values
    igc credentials   Lists the urls and credentials for the tools deployed to the
                        cluster
    igc ingress       List the current ingress hosts for deployed apps in a
                        namespace

    Options:
    --version  Show version number                                       [boolean]
    --help     Show help                                                 [boolean]
    ```

## Use the CLI

Once the CLI is installed, whenever you use it, your command line shell must be logged into your 
IBM Cloud account using the [IBM Cloud CLI](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cli "IBM Cloud CLI and Developer Tools").

- Log into your IBM Cloud account with the correct region and resource group:
    ```bash
    ibmcloud login -a cloud.ibm.com -r <region> -g <resource group>
    ```

- Once logged in, you can use CLI commands.

    For example, this command lists the dashboard URLs for all of the tools:

    ```bash
    igc ingress -n tools
    ```

## Available commands

### vlan

Lists the `vlans` for a particular `resource group` and `region`. The command
expects that an `ibmcloud login` has already been performed to set up the
environment.

### credentials

Prints the urls and credentials for the Catalyst tools deployed into the cluster.
This includes Jenkins, Argo CD, and SonarQube.

### ingress

Lists the ingress urls for the provided namespace. If no namespace
is provided, `dev` is used.

### pipeline

Registers a git repository project as a Jenkins pipeline by creating a Kubernetes secret to hold
the Git authentication information, calling the Jenkins API, and creating a web-hook.
This command is intended to be run within the repository directory of a project for
which a pipeline should be generated.

### tools

Launches the `ibm-garage-cli-tools` docker image in an interactive
terminal. This image provides commonly used infrastructure tools like,
`terraform`, `kubectl`, etc.
