<PageDescription>

The Cloud Developer Tools environment includes the 
[IBM Garage Cloud (IGC) Developer Tools CLI](https://github.com/ibm-garage-cloud/ibm-garage-cloud-cli).

</PageDescription>

The CLI provides a set of helpful utilities that can be invoked from the command line. 
These utilities include:
- List the URLs for the tools installed in the environment
- List the usernames and passwords for the tools installed in the environment
- Build and deploy images to the environment using its registry

To use the CLI, it must be installed and your shell must be logged into IBM Cloud.

## Installation

Follow these steps to use the IGC CLI:
- Install the CLI:
    ```bash
    npm i -g @garage-catalyst/ibm-garage-cloud-cli
    ````
- Run the CLI's help command to list the available commands:
    ```bash
    igc --help
    ```

    The help output looks like this:

    ```bash
    % igc --help

    --help     Show help                                                 [boolean]
    ```

## Use the CLI

Once the CLI is installed, whenever you use it, your shell must be logged into IBM Cloud.

- Log into your IBM Cloud account with the correct region and resource group:
    ```bash
    ibmcloud login -a cloud.ibm.com -r <region> -g <resource group>
    ```

- Once logged in, you can use CLI commands like this one to get the URLs for all of the tools:
    ```bash
    igc ingress
    ```

## Available commands

### vlan

Lists the `vlans` for a particular `resource group` and `region`. The command
expects that an `ibmcloud login` has already been performed to set up the
environment.

### credentials

Prints the urls and credentials for the Catalyst tools deployed into the cluster.
This includes Jenkins, Argo CD, and SonarQube.

### ingress

Lists the ingress urls for the provided namespace. If no namespace
is provided, `dev` is used.

### register

Registers a project as a Jenkins pipeline by creating a Kubernetes secret to hold 
the Git authentication information, calling the Jenkins API, and creating a web-hook.
This command is intended to be run within the repository directory of a project for 
which a pipeline should be generated.
 
### tools

Launches the `ibm-garage-cli-tools` docker image in an interactive
terminal. This image provides commonly used infrastructure tools like,
`terraform`, `kubectl`, etc.
 
## Development

### Run the tests

```bash
npm test
```

### Run the cli locally

```bash

```
