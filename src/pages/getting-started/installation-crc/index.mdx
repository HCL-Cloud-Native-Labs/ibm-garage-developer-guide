Download CRC, install it, and configure it

</PageDescription>

Install and configure CRC as described in 
[Getting started with Red Hat CodeReady Containers](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_codeready_containers/1.0/html/getting_started_guide/getting-started-with-codeready-containers_gsg), 
starting with section 1.5 
[Installing CodeReady Containers](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_codeready_containers/1.0/html/getting_started_guide/getting-started-with-codeready-containers_gsg#installing-codeready-containers_gsg).

Some highlights and comments on installing CRC:
- **CRC executable**: Copy the crc binary to your $PATH:

    From the directory where you untarred the download:

    ```bash
    cp crc /usr/local/bin
    ```

    (Is the file literally named `crc`? Do execute permissions need to be set?)

- **Add memory**: By default, the CRC VM is set to only use 8 GB of RAM. The more RAM you can give it, the better.

    To set it to 10 GB of RAM, do this after `crc setup` but before `crc start`:

    ```bash
    crc config set memory 10240
    ```

<Tab label="Run CRC">

Run the CRC cluster in a VM

</PageDescription>

Run CRC as described in 
[Getting started with Red Hat CodeReady Containers](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_codeready_containers/1.0/html/getting_started_guide/getting-started-with-codeready-containers_gsg), 
starting with section 1.7 
[Starting the virtual machine](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_codeready_containers/1.0/html/getting_started_guide/getting-started-with-codeready-containers_gsg#starting-the-virtual-machine_gsg).

Some highlights and comments on running CRC:
- **Starting CRC**

    To start the CRC VM:

    ```bash
    crc start
    ```

- **CRC console**

    Open the CRC console in a web browser:

    ```bash
    http://console-openshift-console.apps-crc.testing
    ```

    Log into the console using the kube.admin link.
    - The username is `kubeadmin`
    - The password is printed in the terminal window by `crc start`


- **Stopping CRC**

    To stop the CRC VM:

    ```bash
    crc stop
    ```

- **Uninstalling CRC**

    To delete the CRC VM:

    ```bash
    crc delete
    ```

Install the Cloud Developer Tools environment into the CRC cluster

</PageDescription>

Install the Cloud Developer Tools as described in [Cloud Developer Tools Installation](installation). 
However, you really just need to **Clone** the scripts and **Run** them; you can skip the resource steps--see below.

Some highlights and comments on installing the Developer Tools:
- **API keys**

    The credentials file won't be used, but still needs to exist and needs to contain the proper properties keys.
    The values will be ignored. So copy the template file but there's no need to edit it.

    Inside the `iteration-zero-ibmcloud` folder, copy `credentials.template` to a file named `credentials.properties`.

    ```bash
    cd iteration-zero-ibmcloud
    cp credentials.template credentials.properties
    ```

- **TF variables**

    The required variables in `terraform.tfvars` are required for IBM Cloud but are not needed for CRC.
    So there's no need to set the resource group and VLAN properties.

    For the optional variables, the `cluster_type` must be set to OpenShift:

    ```bash
    # The type of cluster that will be created/used (kubernetes or openshift)
    cluster_type="openshift"
    ```

    The other variables will be ignored, so no need to edit them.
