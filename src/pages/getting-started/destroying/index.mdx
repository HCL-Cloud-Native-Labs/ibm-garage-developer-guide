title: Destroying

Once your development tools are configured, Terraform stores the state of the creation in the `workspace` folder. 

It is is possible to destory the development environment following these steps.

- Run the following command to launch a IBM Garage [Developer Tools CLI Tools Docker container](https://github.ibm.com/garage-catalyst/client-tools-image).
```bash
./launch.sh
```

- In the container, change to the `workspace` directory.
```bash
cd workspace
```

- In the container, run the Terraform tool with the `destroy` option.
```bash
terraform destroy
```
This will remove the development cluster and all the services that were created previously.
