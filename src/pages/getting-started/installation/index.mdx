<Tabs>

<Tab label="Pre-requisites">

The IBM Garage for Cloud Developer Tools are hosted in a [IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers) or 
[Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/openshift) cluster to use for cloud native application development. These
instructions explain how to install these tools into an existing cluster or you can access, configure, and run the scripts to create a new cluster.

The following pre-requisites are required before following the setup instructions.

- An IBM Cloud account with:
    - the ability to provision resources to support [Kubernetes](https://cloud.ibm.com/kubernetes/clusters) 
    and [OpenShift](https://cloud.ibm.com/kubernetes/clusters?platformType=openshift) environments
    - the ability to create a [Resource Group](https://cloud.ibm.com/account/resource-groups) for your development resources and admin rights to this resource group
    - a region and zone containing [a pair of public and private VLANs](https://cloud.ibm.com/classic/network/vlans)
- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) installed and running on your local machine
- [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed on your local machine

</Tab>
<Tab label="1. Clone">

Clone the [ibm-garage-iteration-zero](https://github.com/ibm-garage-cloud/ibm-garage-iteration-zero) Git repository to your local filesystem

```bash
git clone git@github.com:ibm-garage-cloud/ibm-garage-iteration-zero.git
```

Switch to the cloned directory

```bash
cd ibm-garage-iteration-zero
```
</Tab>

<Tab label="2. API keys">

A Kubernetes or OpenShift clutser is a PaaS resource hosted in IaaS resources. 
API keys authenticate an [IBM Cloud CLI](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cli "IBM Cloud CLI and Developer Tools") 
client--such as a Terraform script--to create these resources programatically. Two keys will be needed:
- The first Key is for the Classic Infrastructure (IaaS) resources
- The second key is for the IBM Cloud (PaaS) resources

The following steps create the required keys and put them into a file called `credentials.properties`.

```properties
classic.username=<CLASSIC_USERNAME>
classic.api.key=<CLASSIC_API_KEY>
ibmcloud.api.key=<IBMCLOUD_API_KEY>
```

The Iteration Zero scripts will use these settings to authenticate to IBM Cloud.

### Step A. Create the credentials.properties file

- Inside the `iteration-zero-ibmcloud` folder, copy `credentials.template` to a file named `credentials.properties`.

```bash
cd iteration-zero-ibmcloud
cp credentials.template credentials.properties
```

The `credentials.properties` file is already listed in the `.gitignore` file so that the file containing 
your private API keys will not be pushed to the server repository.

### Step B. Set the Classic infrastructure API key

- Follow these instructions to [create a Classic infrastructure API key](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/iam?topic=iam-classic_keys "Managing classic infrastructure API keys"):

    - In the IBM Cloud console, go to the IBM Cloud API Keys page

    To open the IBM Cloud API Keys page, select **Manage -> Access (IAM)**, then select the **IBM Cloud API keys** tab.

    - If your account already has a classic infrastructure API key, it will appear in the list of keys as **Classic infrastructure API key**. Otherwise, the page will have a **Create a classic infrastructure API key** button on the top. To crate the key, press that button and close the dialog.

    ![API Keys](apikeys.png)

    - Find **Classic infrastructure API key** in the list and open its details.

    ![Classic Keys](classickeys.png)

- Edit the `credentials.properties` file to set the values for the `classic.username` and `classic.api.key` properties.

### Step C. Set the IBM Cloud API key

- Follow these instructions to create an IBM Cloud API key:

    - [Managing user API keys](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/iam?topic=iam-userapikey "Managing user API keys")

- Edit the `credentials.properties` file to set the value for the `ibmcloud.api.key` property.

</Tab>

<Tab label="3. TF Variables">

The settings for creating the Cloud Developer Tools environment go in a properties file called `terraform.tfvars`. 
The process that creates the environment can create a new cluster for the environment or install the environment 
into an existing cluster. With either a new or existing cluster, these `terraform.tfvars` variables must be set.

The file you will edit is `./terraform/settings/terraform.tfvars`. The next few steps will find the necessary 
resources and set them in the `terraform.tfvars` file. Along the way, if any of these resources don't already exist, 
you'll need to create them.

The file consists of two parts: required varialbes and optional variables. There is a tool for optionally generating
the required variables. The optional variables have default values which assume the environment will create a new 
cluster; change them to use an existing cluster.

### Required variables

Several of the variables are required and have no reasonable defaults, therefore you will need to set them.

Typical values look like this:

```bash
resource_group_name="catalyst-team"
vlan_region="us-south"
vlan_datacenter="dal10"
public_vlan_id="2366011"
private_vlan_id="2366012"
cluster_name="catalyst-team-cluster"
```

### Optional: Generate the properties

If you want to use specific settings, such as for an existing cluster, then skip this step. 
This tool is for users who don't know what these required settings should be and want a simple way 
to gather reasonable defaults for their particular account.

The [Cloud Developer Tools CLI](../getting-started/cli) has a command to gather this information for you, 
in a format that is easy to cut/paste into the `terraform.tfvars` properties file. 

```bash
igc vlan
```

Note that you need to log into your account using the IBM Cloud CLI to use this tool.

### Optional variables

The remaining properties are also required but have reasonable defaults, so setting them is optional.

The values look like this:

```bash
# The type of cluster that will be created/used (kubernetes or openshift)
cluster_type="kubernetes"
# Flag indicating if we are using an existing cluster or creating a new one
cluster_exists="false"
# Flag indicating if we are using an existing PostgreSQL server or creating a new one
postgres_server_exists="false"
```

### Scenarios

These are scenarios for using these optioal settings:
- To specify whether the cluster (new or existing) is Kubernetes or OpenShift, set `cluster_type`.

- To specify installing the tools into an existing cluster, set `cluster_exists`, `cluster_type`, and  `cluster_name`.

- To specify that the existing cluster already has a PostgreSQL service instance, set `postgres_server_exists`.

</Tab>

<Tab label="3a. Resource Group">

The Cloud Developer Tools environment consists of several IBM Cloud resources--a Kubernetes or OpenShift cluster, 
some cloud service instances, etc. [IBM Cloud Identity and Access Management](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/iam "Managing identity and access") 
manages access to resources by organizing them into resource groups, so that one access policy can easily be applied 
to all of the resources in a group. 

In `terraform.tfvars`, set the `resource_group_name` property to specify the resource group for the environment's resources. 
This resource group will help distinguish the Cloud Developer Tools resources from the other resources in the same IBM Cloud account. 
The resource group can be a new one--see the instructions below. If using an existing cluster, specify the
cluster's resource group.

- Follow these instructions to create a resource group:

    - [Creating a resource group](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/resources?topic=resources-rgs#create_rgs "Creating and managing resource groups")

</Tab>

<Tab label="3b. VLANs">

The Cloud Developer Tools environment will be installed in either a Kubernetes or OpenShift cluster, either
a new one or an existing one. In IBM Cloud, a single zone cluster is 
[hosted in a particular zone in a particular region](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/overview?topic=overview-zero-downtime#ov_intro_reg "Locations for resource deployment"). 
If the environment will go in a new cluster and the account you're using has multiple regions and zones, 
you need to decide what region and zone you'll want the cluster cerated in. 
If the environment will be installed in an existing cluster, specify the region and zone that cluster is already in.

In `terraform.tfvars`, set the following properties:
- `vlan_region` -- The region that the cluster is or will be in
- `vlan_datacenter` -- The zone in that region that the cluster is or will be in

The [networking in a Kubernetes or OpenShift cluster](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-plan_clusters#plan_basics "Understanding network basics of classic clusters") 
consists of (at a minimum) two VLANs, a public VLAN and a private VLAN. 
If creating a new cluster, specify a pair of VLANs in the desired region and zone.
If the environment will be installed in an existing cluster, specify the VLANs that cluster is using.

In `terraform.tfvars`, set the following properties:
- `public_vlan_id` -- The public VLAN that the cluster is or will be using
- `private_vlan_id` -- The private VLAN that the cluster is or will be using

An earlier step talked about using the `igc vlan` command in the [Cloud Developer Tools CLI](../getting-started/cli)
to gather these VLAN settings. Advanced users who want to specifiy more specific settings have 
two approaches for determing the VLAN info:
- If using an existing cluster, determine the VLANs it's using
- If using a new cluster, select existing VLANs (or create new ones) in the desired region and zone

Either way, once you determine the VLAN info, you need to set it in the `terraform.tfvars` properties file.

### Option A. Select existing cluster's VLANs (Advanced)

If installing the environment into an existing cluster, specifiy the VLANs that the cluster is using.
Each worker node in a cluster's worker pool connects to a public VLAN and private VLAN.
In the IBM Cloud console, the VLANs are shown on the cluster's page in the **Worker Nodes** tab.

### Option B. Select from account's VLAN list (Advanced)

[Getting started with VLANs](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/infrastructure/vlans "VLANs") explains how to open the
VLAN List page in the console. Choose the public and private VLANs for the region and zone you want to
host the Cloud Developer Tools environment. If suitable VLANs don't already exist, you can create them here.

<Tab label="4. Run">

Having configured the `credentials.properties` and `terraform.tfvars` files, we are now ready to kick off the installation.

- Launch a [IBM Garage for Cloud Developer Tools Docker container](https://github.com/ibm-garage-cloud/ibm-garage-cli-tools "Cloud Garage Tools Docker image").

    Run the following command to run the Docker container:

    ```bash
    ./launch.sh
    ```

    This will install the Cloud Garage Tools Docker image and exec shell into the running container. The container will 
    mount the filesystem's `./terraform/` directory as `/home/devops/src/`. Once the Docker container has started and 
    the script has exec shelled into it, you will see an IBM Garage banner. This will help you identify you are running 
    inside the Docker image that has just mounted your file system.

    ```bash
    % ./launch.sh
    Cleaning up old container: ibm-garage-cli-tools-abcde

    Run 'image-help' to get a list of available tools, scripts, and ENV properties
    ```

    The `image-help` command shows what can be done in this conatiner:

    ```bash
    $ image-help
    Available env properties (can be overridden for individual commands):
    > BM_API_KEY - the IBM Cloud api key
    > REGION - the IBM Cloud region (e.g. us-south)
    > RESOURCE_GROUP - the IBM Cloud resource group
    > CLUSTER_NAME - the name of the kubernetes cluster in IBM Cloud
    > SL_USERNAME - the Classic Infrastructure user name or API user name (e.g. 282165_joe@us.ibm.com)
    > SL_API_KEY - the Classic Infrastructure api key

    Available tools:
    > terraform (with helm, kube, and ibm provider plugins)
    > calicoctl
    > ibmcloud (with container-service, container-registry, and cloud-databases plugins)
    > kubectl
    > kustomize
    > oc
    > helm
    > docker
    > git
    > nvm
    > node (v11.12.0 currently installed)
    > yo

    Available scripts:
    > init.sh {BM_API_KEY} {REGION} {RESOURCE_GROUP} {CLUSTER_NAME}
    > createNamespaces.sh
    > deleteNamespace.sh
    > installHelm.sh
    > cluster-pull-secret-apply.sh
    > setup-namespace-pull-secrets.sh
    > checkPodRunning.sh
    > copy-secret-to-namespace.sh
    ```

- Create the Cloud Developer Tools environment

    The supplied Terraform script is ready to run using the settings in `terraform.tfvars`. 
    You optionally can extend or modify the scripts and tailor them for your project's specific needs.

    Run this script in the container:

    ```bash
    ./runTerraform.sh
    ```

    This script will create the Cloud Developer Tools environment.

    The script will verify some basic settings and prompt if you want to proceed. After you select **Y** (for yes), 
    the Terraform Apply process will begin to create the infrastructure and services for your environment.

    If `terraform.tfvars` specifies an existing cluster, the contents will be cleaned up to prepare for the terraform 
    process. Any resources in the `tools`, `dev`, `test`, and `staging` namespaces will be deleted.

    Creating a new cluster takes about 1.5 hours on average (but can also take considerably longer) 
    and the rest of the process takes about 30 minutes. At the end, you should have your Cloud Developer Tools environment 
    fully provisioned and configured. Enjoy!

### Cloud Developer Tools environment

Once the Terraform scripts have finished, you can see the resources that the scripts created in IBM Cloud:
- In the IBM Cloud console, open the [Resource List](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/overview?topic=overview-ui#dashboardview "Managing resources in the resource list")
- On the Resource List page, filter by your Resource Group (e.g. `catalyst-team`)
- You should see these resources listed:
    - **Clusters**: 1, either Kubernetes or OpenShift
    - **Services**: 5 or so, such as PostgreSQL, LogDNA, etc.
    - **Storage**: 1, an instance of Cloud Object Storage
- Select the cluster and open the Kubernetes dashboard or OpenShift web console. You should see:
    - Namespaces: `tools`, `dev`, `test`, and `staging`
    - Deployments in the `tools` namespace: `catalyst-dashboard`, `jenkins`, etc.

### Possible issues

If you find that that the Terraform provisioning has failed, try re-running the `runTerraform.sh` script again. 
The state will be saved and Terraform will try and apply the configuration to match the desired end state.

If you find that some of the services have failed to create in the time allocated, you can try this:
- Manually delete the service instances in your resource group
- Delete the `workspace` directory (which will remove any state that has been created by Terraform)
- Re-run the `runTerraform.sh` script

```bash
rm -rf workspace
./runTerraform.sh
```
