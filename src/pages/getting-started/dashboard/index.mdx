title: Developer Tools Dashboard

<PageDescription>

The Cloud Developer Tools environment includes the Cloud Developer Tools Dashboard to help you navigate to the installed tools.

</PageDescription>

![Dashboard](devcluster.png)

The Dashboard is installed into your Developer Tools cluster. It is designed to give you a simple way 
to perform common Developer Tools tasks, such as:
- **Dashboard**: Navigate to the tools installed in the cluster
- **Activation**: Links to education to help you learn cloud-native development and deployment 
using IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service and Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud
- **Starter Kits**: Links to templates that will help accelerate your project

<InlineNotification>

If the Developer Tools are installed in an OpenShift cluster that includes the **IBM Cloud Pak for Applications**, 
the Developer Tools will compliment the Cloud Pak's **Tekton Pipelines** and **Transformation Advisor**. 
You can link out to these tools as an alternative pipeline technology to **Jenkins**.

### Opening the Dashboard

- Open a terminal
- Make sure you are logged into your Development cluster in a terminal.
- To do so, navigate to your cluster in the _IBM Cloud Console_, click on the **Access** tab and
follow the instructions to login from the command line
- You can test this with the following simple command.

<Accordion>

  <AccordionItem title="OpenShift">

    oc get nodes

  </AccordionItem>

  <AccordionItem title="Kubernetes">

    kubectl get nodes

  </AccordionItem>

</Accordion>

<p></p>

- To open the Dashboard, use the [IGC CLI](/guides/cli).
    ```
    igc dashboard
    ```

- This will open the Dashboard

### Access the tools URLs

- To list the ingress endpoints for all of the installed tools, use the [Developer Tools CLI](../getting-started/cli) to run the following command:
    ```bash
    igc ingress -n tools
    ```

- This will return the ingress URLs for all of the tools installed in the Developer Tools cluster.
    ```bash
    Host(s):
    [
      'https://grpc.argocd.showcase-dev-iks-cluster.us-south.containers.appdomain.cloud',
      'https://argocd.showcase-dev-iks-cluster.us-south.containers.appdomain.cloud',
      'https://artifactory.showcase-dev-iks-cluster.us-south.containers.appdomain.cloud',
      'https://dashboard.showcase-dev-iks-cluster.us-south.containers.appdomain.cloud',
      'https://jenkins.showcase-dev-iks-cluster.us-south.containers.appdomain.cloud',
      'https://pact.showcase-dev-iks-cluster.us-south.containers.appdomain.cloud',
      'https://sonarqube.showcase-dev-iks-cluster.us-south.containers.appdomain.cloud'
    ]
    ```

-  You can then select the URL to open the tools dashboard directly.

### Credentials

In the future, the tools in the Dashboard will be linked using a single sign-on (SSO) service. 
In the meantime, the CLI includes a command to list the tools' logins.

- To list the logins for all of the installed tools, use the [Developer Tools CLI](../getting-started/cli) to run the following command:
    ```bash
    igc credentials
    ```

- The command lists the `userid` and `password` for each tool installed. You can use these credentials to log into each of the installed tools.

<InlineNotification>

If you are using OpenShift, the Jenkins credential
will be `undefined` because the OpenShift built in Jenkins service uses IBM cloud single sign-on mechanism.
