<InlineNotification>

If you install into an OpenShift Cluster that has **IBM Cloud Pak for Applications** the Developer Tools will compliment
the installed tools **Tekton Pipelines** and **Transformation Advisor** and you can link out to these tools as optional pipeline
technology to **Jenkins**

</InlineNotification>


The Dashboard is installed into your development cluster, it has been designed to give you a simple way of compeleting the following tasks.

- Navigate to the installed tools within the cluster
- Give you links to common **Activation** education to help you understand cloud native development with IBM Kubernetes Services and Red Had OpenShift
- Links to **Starter Kit Templates** that will help accelerate your project

## Opening the Dashboard

To open the Dashboard, use the [Cloud Developer Tools CLI](../getting-started/cli) to obtain the ingress endpoint, 
then use that endpoint to open the Dashboard.

To list the ingress endpoints for all the installed tools use the following command:

```bash
igc ingress -n tools
```

This will return the ingress URLs.

```bash
Host(s):
[
  'https://grpc.argocd.showcase-dev-iks-cluster.us-south.containers.appdomain.cloud',
  'https://argocd.showcase-dev-iks-cluster.us-south.containers.appdomain.cloud',
  'https://artifactory.showcase-dev-iks-cluster.us-south.containers.appdomain.cloud',
  'https://dashboard.showcase-dev-iks-cluster.us-south.containers.appdomain.cloud',
  'https://jenkins.showcase-dev-iks-cluster.us-south.containers.appdomain.cloud',
  'https://pact.showcase-dev-iks-cluster.us-south.containers.appdomain.cloud',
  'https://sonarqube.showcase-dev-iks-cluster.us-south.containers.appdomain.cloud'
]
```

Select the URL called `dashboard` and open it in your browser.


### Credentials

Currently the tools are not linked to a single sign-on service (future plan other than Jenkins in OpenShift).
To obtain the credentials for the tools login into ibm cloud account on the command line and run `igc credentials` this 
will list the `userids` and `passwords` secrets for each tool installed.
```bash
igc credentials
```

You can use the credentials information to log into each of the installed tools.

<InlineNotification>

If you are using OpenShift the Jenkins credential
will be `undefined` as OpenShift using single sign on mechanism with its built in Jenkins service.
