title: Developer Tools Dashboard

<PageDescription>

The Cloud Developer Tools environment includes the Cloud Developer Tools Dashboard to help you navigate to the installed tools.

</PageDescription>

![Dashboard](devcluster.png)

The Dashboard is installed into your Developer Tools cluster. It is designed to give you a simple way 
to perform common Developer Tools tasks, such as:
- **Dashboard**: Navigate to the tools installed in the cluster
- **Activation**: Links to education to help you learn cloud-native development and deployment 
using IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service and Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud
- **Starter Kits**: Links to templates that will help accelerate your project

<InlineNotification>

If the Developer Tools are installed in an OpenShift cluster that includes the **IBM Cloud Pak for Applications**, 
the Developer Tools will compliment the Cloud Pak's **Tekton Pipelines** and **Transformation Advisor**. 
You can link out to these tools as an alternative pipeline technology to **Jenkins**.

## Opening the Dashboard

To open the Dashboard, follow these steps to obtain its URL and open it in a browser.

To list the ingress endpoints for all of the installed tools, 
use the [Developer Tools CLI](../getting-started/cli) to run the following command:

```bash
igc ingress -n tools
```

Note that you need to log into your account using the IBM Cloud CLI to use this tool.

This will return the ingress URLs for all of the tools installed in the Developer Tools cluster.

```bash
Host(s):
[
  'https://grpc.argocd.showcase-dev-iks-cluster.us-south.containers.appdomain.cloud',
  'https://argocd.showcase-dev-iks-cluster.us-south.containers.appdomain.cloud',
  'https://artifactory.showcase-dev-iks-cluster.us-south.containers.appdomain.cloud',
  'https://dashboard.showcase-dev-iks-cluster.us-south.containers.appdomain.cloud',
  'https://jenkins.showcase-dev-iks-cluster.us-south.containers.appdomain.cloud',
  'https://pact.showcase-dev-iks-cluster.us-south.containers.appdomain.cloud',
  'https://sonarqube.showcase-dev-iks-cluster.us-south.containers.appdomain.cloud'
]
```

Select the URL called `dashboard` and open it in your browser.


### Credentials

In the future, the tools in the Dashboard will be linked using a single sign-on (SSO) service. 
In the meantime, the CLI includes a command to list the tools' logins.

To list the logins for all of the installed tools, 
use the [Developer Tools CLI](../getting-started/cli) to run the following command:

```bash
igc credentials
```

The command lists the `userid` and `password` for each tool installed. 
You can use these credentials to log into each of the installed tools.

<InlineNotification>

If you are using OpenShift, the Jenkins credential
will be `undefined` because OpenShift with its built in Jenkins service uses a single sign-on mechanism.
