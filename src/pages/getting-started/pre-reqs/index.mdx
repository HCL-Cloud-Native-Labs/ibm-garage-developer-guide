## Github

- You will need to have a public Github account. If you do not have one create one. If you have not logged in for a while make sure your login is working.

### Configure Github Personal Access Token
- For Jenkins to connect to and use your GitHub repo, it will need a
- [GitHub personal access token](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line) with `public_repo` and `write:repo_hook` scopes. The Personal Access Token only needs to be generated once then it can be used to access multiple GitHub repos.

  - Navigate to [Developer Settings](https://github.com/settings/tokens) and generate a new token
  - Select `public_repo` scope to enable git clone
  - Select `write:repo_hook` scope so Jenkins can create a web hook
