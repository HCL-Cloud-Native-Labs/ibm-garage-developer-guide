description: Complete the setup of the ArgoCD tool so it can use Artifactory as a Helm repository
---

## Overview
ArgoCD is a complete **GitOps** tool for managing the deployment of built application images into other development environments this
might include *test*, *pre-prod* and *production*. It uses both the IBM Container Image Registry for sourcing built docker images and uses
Artifactory for sourcing packaged Helm charts from your apps. Complete this setup to enable ArgoCD to be ready to integrate with Artifactory.

Read the following guides to understand how to use it to create combined CI/CD solution read the following guides:

##  Configuration

To enable ArgoCD to work seamlessly with the Developer Tools
installation you need to configure Artifactory to be used as a Helm Chart Repository.
This will enable the use of application Helm charts to be de-coupled from the docker image that is built with the Jenkins CI pipeline.

### Clone ArgoCD Template

Using the ArgoCD Template you can get the `configMap` files required to easily ArgoCD

- Clone the Repository to you development machine

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ibm-garage-cloud/template-argocd-test
cd template-argocd-test
```


### Update ConfigMap for ArgoCD

In the `config` directory there is a `yaml` file called `argocd-helm-repo.yaml`.
Edit this file and modify the `- url:` to point to the URL of the Artifactory Repository.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: argocd-cm
  namespace: tools
data:
  helm.repositories: |
    - url: <artifactory helm repository location>
      name: helm-repository-location
```

You need to have completed the setup of the Artifactory instance so it can store Helm charts from your CI pipeline with Jenkins.

You need to select

To obtain the `- url: ` you start by logging into Artifactory and clicking on `Setup Me Up` tile and click on the repository `generic-local`

![Setup](setupartifactory.png "Setup Screen")

This will open the detailed setup view and from here you can copy the URL from the setup screen.

Edit the `argocd-helm-repo.yaml` and replace the value `<artifactory helm repository location>` with the value from the
Artifactory console.

### Run the `kubectl` Command

Now you have edited the `yaml` file you need to make sure you are logged into either the IBM Kubernetes Service or Red Hat OpenShift consoles.

You can test this by running the following commands :

```bash 
kubectl get nodes | oc get nodes
```

There is a helper shell script that you can run called `addconfigmap.sh` this runs the following command to add the details of the Helm Registry with ArgoCD Config map.

```
#!/bin/bash
kubectl apply -f argocd-helm-repo.yaml
```

Once this is complete you can validate the configuration by opening the `argocd-cm` Config Map in the IKS Console or OpenShift Cluster Console.
Navigate to the `tools` namespace and view the `Config Maps` open up the config map called `argocd-cm` and validate the the `Data`
section now has a `helm.repositories` entry that is referencing Artifactory.
