title: Deploying First App
---

## Overview

Now you have prepared your development cluster for Cloud Native application development. You can now create a new app using one of the
Starter Kit Templates. These have been created to include all the key components,configuration and frameworks to get you starting on
creating the code your need for your solutions.

### Open the Developer Dashboard

The Developer dashboard makes it easy for you to navigate to the tools and includes a section that
lists the **Starter Kits Templates**. These templates have been created to give you a more comprehensive
starting point for you apps. Read more in the **[Starter Kits](/starterkits/overview)**.

- Open the Development Dashboard, simple instructions are listed [here](/getting-started/dashboard)
- Click on **Starter Kits** tab

- Make sure you have installed the **Developer Tools CLI** before continuing
    ```bash
    npm i -g @garage-catalyst/ibm-garage-cloud-cli
    ```
- Pick one of the templates that is a good architectural fit for you application and the Language and Framework
that you prefer to work with. Click on the **Tile** to create a new copy from the template.

<InlineNotification>

The templates use the GitHub Templating feature, this means that they will be created into
you Git organisation of your choice with no git history. If you click on the tile it takes you
straight to the template view. If you click on the **Git Icon** it takes you to the source Git Repo

    ```base
    git clone git@github.com:mjperrins/stockbffnode.git
    cd stockbffnode
    ```

### Running Locally

Most developers like to run the code natively in local development environment. Follow the instructions
listed in the **README.md** file to run the code locally. They may be requirements to install
specific runtime's like **Java**, **Node** and **Python**

### Access running App





### Whats Next

Now that you have a running application that is being built and deployed into your development cluster.
The next step is to prepare for Continuous Delivery, Code Analysis and Artifact management.

To enable this complete the setup of the **ArgoCD** and **Artifactory** using these instructions:
