title: Deploying First App
---

## Overview

Now you have prepared your development cluster for Cloud Native application development. You can now create a new app using one of the
Starter Kit Templates. These have been created to include all the key components,configuration and frameworks to get you starting on
creating the code your need for your solutions.

### Open the Developer Dashboard

The Developer dashboard makes it easy for you to navigate to the tools and includes a section that
lists the **Starter Kits Templates**. These templates have been created to give you a more comprehensive
starting point for you apps. Read more in the **[Starter Kits](/starterkits/overview)**.

- Open the Development Dashboard, simple instructions are listed [here](/getting-started/dashboard)
- Click on **Starter Kits** tab

- Make sure you have installed the **Developer Tools CLI** before continuing
    ```bash
    npm i -g @garage-catalyst/ibm-garage-cloud-cli
    ```
- Pick one of the templates that is a good architectural fit for you application and the Language and Framework
that you prefer to work with. Click on the **Tile** to create a new copy from the template.

<InlineNotification>

The templates use the GitHub Templating feature, this means that they will be created into
you Git organisation of your choice with no git history. If you click on the tile it takes you
straight to the template view. If you click on the **Git Icon** it takes you to the source Git Repo

- This will open the the GitHub template generate view. You can see the source git repo displayed
at the top.

- Enter a validate **name** for you project
- Enter a **description** to describe your app
- Select a validate Git Organization that you are authorised to create repositories within.

- Click on **Create repository from template*

- The new repository will be created, next step is to Clone it to your local machine, click
on **Clond or download**
- Copy the clone SSH link, and use the `git clone` command to clone it to your developer desktop machine.
    ```base
    git clone git@github.com:mjperrins/stockbffnode.git
    cd stockbffnode
    ```

### Running Locally

Most developers like to run the code natively in local development environment. Follow the instructions
listed in the **README.md** file to run the code locally. They may be requirements to install
specific runtime's like **Java**, **Node** and **Python**

### Register App Pipeline

Now you have the code in a Git Repository and cloned to you local development environment.
We can now register the repository with Continuous Integration pipeline technology. The default
is **Jenkins**. We use the `igc` command line to make this step as simple as possible.

- You will need your GitHub personal access token with web hook authority,
Navigate to [Developer Settings](https://github.com/settings/tokens) and click **Generate new token**.
Save the token and place it in your clipboard.

- To register the app follow these steps.
    ```bash
    igc pipeline
    ? Please provide the username for https://github.com/mjperrins/hello-world-bff.git: mperrins
    ? Please provide your password/personal access token: [hidden]
    ? Please provide the branch the pipeline should use: master
    Creating git secret
    Copying 'ibmcloud-apikey' secret to dev
    Registering pipeline
    ```
- Enter your GitHub user id, past your Personal Access token and select the default git branch or type
in another branch you want to register.

-- The pipeline will be registered.

Note: Tekton support will be coming soon.

### View App Pipeline

Using the Developer Dashboard, navigate back to you Jenkins instance. If you have it open
already refresh the page.

- You will see you pipeline registered.

- Click on your app pipeline and click **Build Now**.

- Wait for the pipeline stages to start building.

- Open it has complete you should see a view similar to the one below.

### Access running App

Once the pipeline has completed successfully the app will be deployed into the `dev` namespace
in Kubernetes or Openshift. You can now access the app to test it.

- To Access the app, retrieve the app ingress endpoint using command below.
    ```bash
    igc ingress -n dev
    ```
- You will see a list of apps displayed with their ingress URL.
    ```base
    Host(s):
    [
      'http://stockbffapp-dev.showcase-dev-iks-cluster.us-south.containers.appdomain.cloud'
    ]

- You can now open this ingress URL in your browser to validate its working as expected.

- This completes the deployment of your first app.

### Whats Next

Now that you have a running application that is being built and deployed into your development cluster.
The next step is to prepare for Continuous Delivery, Code Analysis and Artifact management.

To enable this complete the setup of the **ArgoCD** and **Artifactory** using these instructions:
