title: Deploying An App
---

<PageDescription>

Use a Starter Kit Template to create a sample app and the Jenkins pipeline to deploy it into the cluster

</PageDescription>

## Overview

Now that you have prepared your Developer Tools environment for cloud-native application development, 
you can now create a new app using one of the Starter Kit Templates. These have been created to include all the key 
components, configuration, and frameworks to get you started on creating the code you need for your solutions.

### Demonstration video

This video will demo how to get started with using the Dashboard to develop and deploy an app.
It shows how to do the steps that are described below.

<Video src="/videos/deployfirstapp.m4v" type="video/m4v" poster="/images/poster.png"/>

### Open the Developer Tools Dashboard

The Developer Tools Dashboard makes it easy for you to navigate to the tools, including a section that
lists the [Starter Kit Templates](/starterkits/overview). These templates have been created to give you 
a more comprehensive starting point for you apps.

- Install the [IGC CLI](/getting-started/cli)
- Open the [Developer Tools Dashboard](/getting-started/dashboard)
- Click on **Starter Kits** tab
- Pick one of the templates that is a good architectural fit for you application and the language and framework
that you prefer to work with. Click on the tile to create a new copy repository from the template repository.
(You can also click on the **Git Icon** to browse the template repository.)

<InlineNotification>

Each Starter Kit Template is a [GitHub template repository](https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/creating-a-template-repository). 
This feature copies the directory structure and files of a template repository into a new repository in your 
organisation with no git history.

</InlineNotification>

- Complete the [GitHub create repository from template](https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template) 
view to create the new repository
  - You can see the source git repo displayed at the top
  - **Owner**: Select a validate GitHub organization that you are authorised to create repositories within
  - **Repository name**: Enter a valid name for you repo
  - **Description**: Describe your app
    ![Template](template.png)
  - Press **Create repository from template**

The new repository will be created. Next, clone it to your local machine.
- Click on **Clone or download**
- Copy the clone SSH link, and use the `git clone` command to clone it to your developer desktop machine.
    ```base
    git clone git@github.com:mjperrins/stockbffnode.git
    cd stockbffnode
    ```

### Running Locally

Most developers like to run the code natively in local development environment. To do so, follow the instructions
listed in the **README.md** file to run the code locally. You may be required to install a
specific runtime like **Java**, **Node**, or **Python**.

### Register App Pipeline

You now have the code in a GitHub repository and have cloned it to you local development environment.
We can now register the repository with the Continuous Integration pipeline technology. 

The default CI pipeline tool is currently **Jenkins**. (Tekton support will be coming soon.)
We use the [IGC CLI](/getting-started/cli) to assist with these steps.

#### Prerequisite - Create a GitHub personal access token

For Jenkins to connect to and use your GitHub repo, it will need a 
[GitHub personal access token](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line) 
with `public_repo` and `write:repo_hook` scopes. The Personal Access Token only needs
to be generated once then it can be used to access multiple GitHub repos.

  - Navigate to [Developer Settings](https://github.com/settings/tokens) and generate a new token
  - Select `public_repo` scope to enable git clone
  - Select `write:repo_hook` scope so Jenkins can create a web hook
  ![Jenkins OAuth scopes](jenkins-scopes.png)
  - Save the token and place it in your clipboard


- You can now register your app repo with Jenkins
#### Register the repo with Jenkins

- Open a terminal
- Make sure you are logged into your Development cluster in the terminal. To do so, navigate to your cluster in the IBM Cloud Console, click on the **Access** tab and 
follow the instructions to login from the command line. You can test this with the following simple command.
    ```base
    # Kubernetes
    kubectl get nodes

    # OpenShift
    oc get nodes
    ```
- Change to the repo directory
    ```bash
  cd {path to cloned repo}
    ```
- Register your repo using the `igc pipeline` command. The CLI will read the Git repo information from
the directory and prompt for the credentials required to access the repo. 
  - **Username**: Enter your GitHub user id
  - **Password**: Paste your personal access token
  - **Branch**: Select the default git branch or type in another branch you want to register
    ```bash
    $ igc pipeline
    Project git repo: https://github.com/mjperrins/stockbffnode.git
    ? Provide the username: mperrins
    ? Please provide your password/personal access token: [hidden]
    ? Please provide the branch the pipeline should use: master
    Creating secret with git credentials
    Registering pipeline
    Creating git webhook
    ```

  The pipeline will be registered.

### View App Pipeline

Using the Developer Tools Dashboard, open the Jenkins dashboard. If you already have it open, 
refresh the page.

<InlineNotification>

Note: You will have to log into the Jenkins dashboard. To get the username and password, 
run `igc credentials` using the [IGC CLI](getting-started/cli).

</InlineNotification>

You will see you pipeline registered.

Build and deploy your app
- Click on your app pipeline and click **Build Now**

Wait for the pipeline stages to start building.
Once the stages have completed, you should see a view similar to the one below.

![Jenkins Pipeline](pipeline.png)

### Access running app

Once the pipeline has completed successfully, the app will be deployed into the `dev` namespace
in your Kubernetes or OpenShift cluster. You can now access the app to test it.

- To access the app, retrieve the app ingress endpoint using command below
    ```bash
    igc ingress -n dev
    ```
  
  You will see a list of apps displayed with their ingress URLs
    ```bash
    Host(s):
    [
      'http://stockbffnode-dev.showcase-dev-iks-cluster.us-south.containers.appdomain.cloud'
    ]

- Open this ingress URL in your browser and validate the app is working as expected

This completes the deployment of your first app.

### Complete the setup

You now have a running application that is being built and deployed into your development cluster.
The next step is to prepare for Continuous Delivery, Code Analysis, and Artifact Management.

To enable this, follow these instructions to complete the setup of the **ArgoCD** and **Artifactory**:
