title: Deploying First App
---

## Overview

Now that you have prepared your development cluster for cloud-native application development, you can now create a new app using one of the
Starter Kit Templates. These have been created to include all the key components, configuration, and frameworks to get you started on
creating the code you need for your solutions.

## Demonstration video

This video will demo how to get started with using the Dashboard to develop an app.

### Open the Developer Tools Dashboard

The Developer Tools Dashboard makes it easy for you to navigate to the tools and includes a section that
lists the **Starter Kits Templates**. These templates have been created to give you a more comprehensive
starting point for you apps. Read more in the **[Starter Kits](/starterkits/overview)**.

- Install the [IGC CLI](/getting-started/cli)
- Open the [Developer Tools Dashboard](/getting-started/dashboard)
- Click on **Starter Kits** tab
- Pick one of the templates that is a good architectural fit for you application and the language and framework
that you prefer to work with. Click on the **Tile** to create a new copy repository from the template repository.

<InlineNotification>

The templates use the [GitHub Templating feature](https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template), 
which copies the directory structure and files of a template repository into a new repository in your organisation with no git history.
Click on the tile to create a repository from that template. Click on the **Git Icon** to browse the template repository.

</InlineNotification>

- This will open the the GitHub template copy view. You can see the source git repo displayed
at the top.
  - **Owner**: Select a validate GitHub organization that you are authorised to create repositories within
  - **Repository name**: Enter a valid name for you repo
  - **Description**: Describe your app
    ![Template](template.png)
  - Press **Create repository from template**

The new repository will be created. Next, clone it to your local machine.
- Click on **Clone or download**
- Copy the clone SSH link, and use the `git clone` command to clone it to your developer desktop machine.
    ```base
    git clone git@github.com:mjperrins/stockbffnode.git
    cd stockbffnode
    ```

### Running Locally

Most developers like to run the code natively in local development environment. Follow the instructions
listed in the **README.md** file to run the code locally. They may be requirements to install
specific runtime's like **Java**, **Node**, and **Python**.

### Register App Pipeline

Now you have the code in a GitHub repository and cloned to you local development environment.
We can now register the repository with Continuous Integration pipeline technology. 

The default CI pipeline tool is currently **Jenkins**. (Tekton support will be coming soon.)
We use the [IGC CLI](/getting-started/cli) to assist with these steps.

- You will need a [GitHub personal access token](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line) 
with [`read:org` scope](https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/GitHub+OAuth+Plugin#GitHubOAuthPlugin-CallingJenkinsAPIusingGitHubPersonalAccessTokens) 
and `repo` scope.

  - Navigate to [Developer Settings](https://github.com/settings/tokens) and generate a new token. 
  Jenkins will use this token to access the code in your repo.
  - Save the token and place it in your clipboard.

- To register the app follow these steps.
    ```bash
    $ igc pipeline
    Project git repo: https://github.com/mjperrins/stockbffnode.git
    ? Provide the username: mperrins
    ? Please provide your password/personal access token: [hidden]
    ? Please provide the branch the pipeline should use: master
    Creating secret with git credentials
    Registering pipeline
    Creating git webhook
    ```
- Enter your GitHub user id, paste your personal access token, and select the default git branch or type
in another branch you want to register.

  The pipeline will be registered.


### View App Pipeline

Using the Developer Tools Dashboard, open the Jenkins dashboard. If you already have it open, 
refresh the page.

<InlineNotification>

Note: You will have to log into the Jenkins dashboard. To get the username and password, 
run `igc credentials` using the [IGC CLI](getting-started/cli).

</InlineNotification>

- You will see you pipeline registered.

- Click on your app pipeline and click **Build Now**.

- Wait for the pipeline stages to start building.

- Once the stages have completed, you should see a view similar to the one below.

### Access running App

Once the pipeline has completed successfully, the app will be deployed into the `dev` namespace
in Kubernetes or Openshift. You can now access the app to test it.

- To access the app, retrieve the app ingress endpoint using command below.
    ```bash
    igc ingress -n dev
    ```
- You will see a list of apps displayed with their ingress URLs.
    ```bash
    Host(s):
    [
      'http://stockbffnode-dev.showcase-dev-iks-cluster.us-south.containers.appdomain.cloud'
    ]

- Open this ingress URL in your browser and validate the app is working as expected.

- This completes the deployment of your first app.

### What's Next

Now you have a running application that is being built and deployed into your development cluster.
The next step is to prepare for Continuous Delivery, Code Analysis, and Artifact Management.

To enable this, follow these instructions to complete the setup of the **ArgoCD** and **Artifactory**:
